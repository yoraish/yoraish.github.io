Hi hello! 

I am Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">The Robotics Institute </a>, Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by 
Professor <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/"> Maxim Likhachev </a>,
and 
Professor <a href="https://jiaoyangli.me/"> Jiaoyang Li </a>. We currently work on planning and learning in multi-agent settings.
<!-- I had the pleasure of working with Professor -->
<!-- <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/"> Sebastian Scherer  </a> -->
<!-- during my first year at CMU. We focused on applying deep learning for visual odometry estimation. -->

Previously, I was at <a href="https://mitathletics.com/sports/mens-track-and-field/roster/yorai-shaoul/8900">MIT</a> working in CSAIL at 
<a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/nicholas-roy/">Nicholas Roy's </a> 
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/" >Robust Robotics Group </a>, and I was fortunate to <del>play with robots</del> spend time at 
<a href="https://www.indoor-robotics.com/" >Indoor Robotics</a>, 
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/robotics" >Amazon Robotics</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/optimus-ride-acquired-by-magna/" >Optimus Ride</a>.

<!-- Robot teams aid humans in transportation, agriculture, logistics, and other domains. To make this a reality, we need algorithms that scale better in dimension and in system-size. My focus is on developing algorithms that utilize geometric principles, multimodal deep learning, and planning on graphs for improving single- and multi-agent robot systems operating in the real world.  -->
